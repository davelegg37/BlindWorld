		<div>Welcome to Blind World where you will, in a small way, experience the world of the blind.
Your main task in blind world is to use the controller to navigate the bottom to the top of a room filled with objects which you cannot see. Each time you hit an unseen object your frustration level goes up and you are returned to the start. If you reach the top you will get 4 success points. Your total score is your success points - you frustration points.
If you get to frustrated you can take a quick peek at all the objects in the room (10sec) but you will receive 3 frustration points each time you do.</div>

		<div>Welcome to Blind World where you will, in a small way, experience the world of the blind.
Your main task in blind world is to use the controller ( by touching or clicking on the direction arrows ) to navigate from the bottom to the top of a room filled with objects which you cannot see. Each time you hit an unseen object your frustration level goes up and you are returned to the start. If you reach the top you will get 4 success points. Your total score is your success points - your frustration points. (When you click on the start button you will get a 10 second peek at the objects in the room )


If you get to frustrated you can take a quick peek at all the objects in the room (10sec) but you will receive 3 frustration points each time you do.</div>

		<div>Welcome to Wheelchair World may get a glimpse into the life of the disabled through wheelchair.
In this world you must accomplish an assortment of household tasks from your power wheelchair which you control with your joystick. In the game you have eight tasks to perform. For each task you accomplish you receive two task points. To accomplish a task you must maneuver your wheelchair through the house to the appropriate object and engage it in the correct Â alignment. When you have accomplished all your tasks the game ends and your score will be your total task points minus your frustration points.
Life is full of frustrations and if you live in wheelchair world you have more than your share. Each time you unintentionally hit an object or wall not related to your task you receive a frustration point and have to start all over. If you fail to accomplish your goal within the time limit you get a frustration point and have to start over.
